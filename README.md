# polysite
Highly customizable, polymorphic static site generator library, polysite.

polysite is inspired by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) written in Haskell.

## Difference from other static site generator
I know some famous static site generator, like [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
But Zola is not enough customizable for me.

polysite aims to support creating your original static site generator.
